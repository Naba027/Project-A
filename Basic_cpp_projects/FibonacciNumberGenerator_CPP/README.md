#Fibonacci Number Generator C++
This project generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. This tool allows users to input the number of terms they want in the series and outputs the corresponding Fibonacci sequence.

##Test Cases:
We have successfully passed three test cases to ensure the correctness of the Fibonacci number generator:

    Test Case 1: Verified the generation of the Fibonacci series with 10 terms.
    Test Case 2: Confirmed the generator's behavior with a single term.
    Test Case 3: Validated the generator's output with 15 terms.

##Usage:
To execute the Fibonacci number generator on your system, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git

Navigate to the Directory: Change into the directory containing the project files:

        cd project-directory

Compile and Run the Program: Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the fibonacci.cpp file and run the generated executable:

        g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci
        ./fibonacci

Replace g++ with your compiler command if you're using a different compiler.

When prompted, enter the number of terms you want in the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series up to the specified number of terms will be displayed in the terminal.
